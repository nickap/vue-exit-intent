# Enhance User Engagement with Exit Intent Detection.

### A composable to show your modal when a user is about to leave the page or another threshold reached.

[Demo](https://vue-exit-intent.netlify.app/)

The very first version of this package created in favor of [this](https://dev.to/nickap/exit-intent-pop-up-how-to-publish-on-npm-vue-3-3bhm) old guide. [Here](https://dev.to/nickap/use-vue-exit-intent-a-vue-composable-to-power-your-exit-intent-content-4hlh) is an updated article regarding the latest version.

# Usage

### Import the composable and show your content according to the value of `isShowing`.

## Add the package

```
npm i vue-exit-intent
```

## Use the composable

```javascript
<sript setup lang="ts">
import { useVueExitIntent } from 'vue-exit-intent'

const options = {
  LSItemKey: 'local-storage-key',
  handleScrollBars: true
}

const { isShowing, close } = useVueExitIntent(options);
</script>
```

```html
<template>
  <yourModalPopUp v-if="isShowing" @close="close"></yourModalPopUp>
</template>
```

## Available helpers

If you use all available helpers your code would look like this:

```javascript
const {
  isShowing,
  isAllowedToGetTriggered,
  isUnsubscribed,
  close,
  resetState,
  unsubscribe
} = useVueExitIntent(options);
```

`isShowing`: a reactive boolean ref that tracks whether the exit intent popup is currently visible.  
`isAllowedToGetTriggered`: a reactive boolean ref that tracks whether the exit intent popup is allowed to trigger.  
`isUnsubscribed`: a reactive boolean ref that tracks whether the user has unsubscribed from the exit intent popup.  
`close`: a function that closes the exit intent popup and resets any related states (e.g. the isShowing ref).  
`resetState`: a function that resets all state related to the exit intent popup (e.g. isShowing, isAllowedToGetTriggered, isUnsubscribed).  
`unsubscribe`: a function that unsubscribes the user from the exit intent popup.

### Options Description

- **repeatAfterDays**  
  After how many days you want the popup to get triggered again.  
  When a user gets the popup that exact timestamp is stored in localstorage and its taken into account next time the user will visit your page.  
  Giving a zero, the popup will be shown only once! Until the localstrage of the user gets cleared/resets.  
  **Give 0 to disable.**  
  **This one runs a CHECK before show.**

- **scrollPercentageToTrigger**  
  A scroll percentage that if reached by the user, the pop-up will get triggered.  
  **Give 0 to disable.**  
  **This one TRIGGERS the popup.**

- **delaySecondsAndTrigger**  
  Trigger the pop-up after a short delay in seconds, once the page has loaded.  
  **Give 0 to disable.**  
  **This one TRIGGERS the popup.**

- **touchDeviceSensitivity**  
  On touch devices where there is no mouseleave event, the popup will get triggered on fast (touch)scroll up.
  The larger the number you will give, the more sesitive will be the pop-up on touch devices.  
  **Give 0 to disable.**  
  **This one TRIGGERS the popup on touch devices.**

- **triggerOnExitIntent**  
  If false. Mouse out event, and scroll-up-fast for touch devices, will not trigger the pop-up. The user would have to reach delaySecondsAndTrigger or scrollPercentageToTrigger to get the popup.
  If true, your modal pop-up is set to get triggered on user exit-intent.  
  **This one TRIGGERS the popup.**

- **scrollDebounceMillis**  
  Time in milliseconds to debounce user's scrolling

- **triggerOnPageLoad**  
  Show your modal pop-up immediately When a user visits your page.  
  **This one TRIGGERS the popup.**

- **handleScrollBars**  
  Composable will handle the value of: `document.body.style.overflowY`.  
  Will be eather `auto` (when isShowing is `false`), or `hidden` (when isShowing is `true`)

- **LSItemKey**  
  Key of Local Storage item.
  You can use a different key to show multiple pop-ups with different behaviour/content.

- **setupBeforeMount**  
  Determines whether the initialization of the composable occurs during the `onBeforeMount` lifecycle hook instead of the default `onMounted` hook.  
  This options allows you to set up the exit intent before your component is mounted.
